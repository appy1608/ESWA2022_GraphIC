This repository contains the dataset for our Expert System with Applications 2022 paper- [GraphIC: A Graph-based Approach for Identifying Complaints from code-mixed product reviews](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422024630). 


**Ex-ProR Dataset**

We extend the original Product Review dataset released in [Identifying Complaints from Product Reviews: {A} Case Study on Hindi](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2771/AICS2020\_paper\_28.pdf). The Product Review dataset is a collection of product reviews posted on the retail website, Amazon India and the video-sharing platform, YouTube comment section. We manually annotate and extend this dataset (Ex-ProR). Each record in the Ex-ProR dataset comprises domain, reviews, label information, and accompanying annotated sentiment and emotion labels. The dataset consists of 3059 non-complaint and 652 complaint instances.
